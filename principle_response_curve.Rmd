## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
aad <- read.csv('models/data/aad.csv')
aad <- aad %>% 
  subset(!is.na(aad$Cutaneous.Leishmaniasis)) %>% 
  subset(aad$Cutaneous.Leishmaniasis > 0) %>% 
  subset(!is.na(LST_Day))

mod_prc <- prc(aad, aad$Cutaneous.Leishmaniasis, 
               aad$LST_Day)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
